// - The game is played in the browser
// - The user is asked their name via the `prompt()` function. Their name is stored for later use.
// - Questions and answers are stored in variables (only basic types are used).
// - The user's score is initially zero. If they get the the answer correct, the score increases.
// - The user submits their answers via the `prompt()` function.
// - At the end of each answer, the score will either increase or stay the same, and the next question will appear.
// - Once the user has answered all of the questions, an `alert()` function will trigger, letting them know their score given in the following format:

// - **0-2** "Oh wow {name}, you can do better."
// - **3-4** "Keep practicing {name}, you got this!"
// - **5** "Wow {name}, a perfect score!"
